# bypass

Bypass is a open-source Chromium extension designed for privacy. Bypass automatically checks all scripts and blocks the ones that detect ad-blockers. Privacy is a human-right & should not be violated by big-tech companies. Thats why bypass exists.

## Can i copy the source code and use it as a reference?
Yes, it is open-source meaning you can use it for your own desired use. I do not appreciate any clones of bypass on the Google Chrome store used for malicious purposes. Please report those extensions to Google.

###### Clone code:
````git clone hhttps://github.com/deniboi123/bypass.git````
